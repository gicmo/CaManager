Ca²⁺ Manager
============

The Ca²⁺ Manager is an [Image J][ImageJ] plugin to generate kymographs for the analysis of calcium imaging recordings in single neurons. With this plugin, you can trace a region of interest for a given neuron across repetitions of different conditions. The data associated with the region of interest can be exported together with simple metadata information, e.g. the animal age, in a [NIX][nixio] file. The latter can be viewed with the [NixView][nixview] program. Further processing of the data, e.g. averages of specific kymographs, can be done with the [CaAnalysis][analysis] scripts.
